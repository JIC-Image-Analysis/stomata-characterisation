# Stomata finding

This code is intended to locate stomata in confocal image stacks.

## Discussion

We started out by identifying the stomata outlines. For example in series 8 we
know that region 9 represent stomata number 1.

```
python scripts/find_stomata.py data/raw/2014-03-20-Lti6b-GFP-ABA-time-series.lif 8 9
```
